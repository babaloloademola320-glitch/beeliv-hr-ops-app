// Solid-button color per dashboard, matching each role's nav color
// (components/layout/AppShell.tsx's NAV_TONE_STYLES) — project-lead
// direction: primary actions should read as belonging to that dashboard,
// not always default purple. Keys match AppShell's `navTone` prop values.
//
// Fully explicit, ready-to-use classNames (base button layout + size="default"
// utilities from components/ui/button.tsx, copied verbatim, plus our own
// color) — NOT buttonVariants({variant, className}). Two earlier attempts
// through buttonVariants both failed silently: overriding the "default"
// variant's baked-in `bg-primary` with a `bg-[color-mix(...)]` className
// didn't actually replace it (tailwind-merge doesn't reliably dedupe a
// complex arbitrary-value class against it — same root cause as the
// invisible-text bug on app/not-found.tsx's button), and swapping to
// `variant: "ghost"` just traded that bug for a hover-state one (ghost's
// own `hover:bg-muted` competing with ours). Building the full string
// ourselves, with no variant() call at all, means there is nothing else in
// the class list for these colors to conflict with.
// active:scale-[0.99] kept in sync with button.tsx's own buttonVariants
// base — see that file's comment for why this exists.
// rounded-full (was rounded-lg) — project-lead's synthesized-dashboard-
// reference pass: pill-shaped primary buttons are the one consistent
// thread across that whole moodboard grid, so this one shared BASE string
// (every dashboard's primary action goes through it) picks that up
// everywhere at once instead of overriding it dashboard-by-dashboard.
//
// shadow-sm (2026-09-17, was a dual light/dark neumorphic shadow) — the
// premium-SaaS flattening pass replaced that soft-UI touch everywhere else
// (cards, icon chips) with flat shadow-sm, and the old dual shadow here now
// read as inconsistent next to it. Matches components/ui/button.tsx, whose
// own variants carry no shadow class at all (shadow lives only in this
// BASE string, not in buttonVariants) — shadow-sm is the closest match to
// "flat direction" without going fully shadowless on a solid-color button.
