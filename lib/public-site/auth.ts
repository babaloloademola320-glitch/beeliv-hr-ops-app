/**
 * Auth data layer for the public auth screens: THE ONLY place the UI talks to
 * an auth backend.
 *
 * STATUS: BACKEND NOT CONNECTED. Supabase Auth is not wired (the client library
 * is not installed and no tables/auth are configured; see CLAUDE.md). Every
 * function below resolves a clearly-labelled "backend not connected yet" result
 * after a short simulated delay so the screens' loading, success and
 * next-screen flows can be tested end to end.
 *
 * TO CONNECT SUPABASE LATER (one place, screens do not change):
 *   1. Flip AUTH_BACKEND_CONNECTED to true.
 *   2. Replace each function body marked `SWAP POINT` with the real call
 *      (signInWithPassword / signUp / resetPasswordForEmail / resend /
 *      email-link confirmation / updateUser), mapping the response onto the
 *      same AuthResult shape.
 *   3. parseFlowTestState() already returns null once AUTH_BACKEND_CONNECTED
 *      is true, so the `?state=` flow-test preview on /reset-password and
 *      /verify-email/success switches itself off (delete it when convenient).
 *
 * SECURITY: passwords are never stored, logged or echoed by this file. Nothing
 * here writes to localStorage/sessionStorage or the console.
 *
 * ROLE RULE (project lead): only applicants may self-register. signup() always
 * means role = applicant; the UI sends no role. SERVER-SIDE ENFORCEMENT IS
 * REQUIRED LATER: when Supabase is connected it must set role = applicant on
 * signup itself and reject/ignore any client-supplied role or account type.
 * Hiding or omitting the field in this UI is NOT the security control. Login
 * is open to every role, and its failure messages must stay generic (never
 * reveal which roles or accounts exist).
