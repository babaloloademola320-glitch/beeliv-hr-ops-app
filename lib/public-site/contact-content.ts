 * (re-exported 2026-09-26 20:23 - checked for anything newer before this file was
 * written). COPY.md section 6 "Contact" is STALE: it still describes an older
 * 4-option selector ("I'm hiring" / "I need training" / "I want a service
 * audit") with a Role-swaps-to-Company field. The current wireframe has been
 * deliberately simplified to a 3-option selector (work / business / something
 * else) with a fixed field list, and both boards' own inline note says
 * selecting "I'm a business" sends the visitor to the Request Talent form
 * instead - so every business lead lands in one place. The wireframe text
 * below is used verbatim over COPY.md wherever the two disagree.
 *
 * Anything in [square brackets] is a still-open item (COPY.md "Open items
 * before locking" #7: domain + street address) and is rendered visibly
 * bracketed - do not fill it in without the project lead.
