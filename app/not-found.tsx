/**
 * Root 404 boundary. Per node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/
 * 03-file-conventions/not-found.md ("Root app/not-found handles global
 * unmatched URLs", v13.3.0+), this file is what Next.js falls back to for
 * any URL that matches no route at all (e.g. /this-does-not-exist) - nothing
 * matched, so app/(public)/layout.tsx never mounts and this can't rely on it
 * for the Newsreader font, the `.public-site` token scope or MotionRoot.
 * Each is set up locally here instead, mirroring that layout. A second
 * boundary, app/(public)/not-found.tsx, renders the same NotFoundBody for
 * `notFound()` calls thrown from *inside* the (public) tree (e.g. an
 * unknown /jobs/[id]) - that case is caught while (public)/layout.tsx is
 * still mounted, so it never falls back to this file. Both render the exact
 * same page via the shared components/public/NotFoundBody.tsx.
 *
 * Replaces the previous stock/off-wireframe design (bg-auth-glow +
 * StatusMascot — both since deleted; app/error.tsx and app/global-error.tsx
 * now show the approved 500 design). Karla/Inter stay as loaded globally by
 * app/layout.tsx.
